# AVTest_deliverable_2
Similar to AV road testing, AV simulation testing is a very complex task due to the following challenges:
  - Lack of cost-effective automation tool for test scenario and script generation
  - Lack of well-defined adequate validation standards and criteria

The challenge task in the second phase is to ask each team to do their best to select the map(s) and driving route(s) to use effective approaches to generate diverse AV simulation test scenarios and scripts. There are two major objectives: a) achieve good scenario diversity, and b) detect AV problems in the simulation environment.

During this phase, each team is going to create and submit diverse simulation test scenarios and scripts using effective approaches based on the criteria listed in the “Evaluation Criteria” section. Teams can create scenarios based on the reports published by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Submission requirements for Deliverable #2:
 - Scenarios and associated scripts
 - Simulation execution report for all each scenario scripts script (With SVL Simulator 2021.1, a report is generated by enabling the [Create Test Report](https://www.svlsimulator.com/docs/user-interface/web/simulations/#general) option, printing the resulting [Test Results](https://www.svlsimulator.com/docs/user-interface/web/test-results/) screen as a PDF and including that report.)
 - Scenario demo videos(e.g. screen capture video; submit link to YouTube, Google Drive, etc.)
 - Selected scenario trip/route and map information (e.g. which maps were used; include descriptions and/or sketches of routes for ego and NPC trajectories)
 - A (written) simulation test report, which documents the generated test scenarios, classes, scripting methods, simulation test coverage, and problem findings.
